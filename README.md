# Homework-1

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


## Acceptance Criteria 

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Description

My motivation behind this project was to add HTML semantic elements so that the websites source code would be easier to read for other individuals who choose to open the source code. This added more readability to the websites source, making it easier to either replicate, or find errors that others can fix. This project helped me learn how to add semantic elements, and also condense some CSS lines so that it isnt as redundent.
